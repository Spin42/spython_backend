# Context

Your bag, where is it from?
And your shoes? Or your watch bracelet? How were they made?

How can we be sure these items do not come from illegally taken endangered
species? And that buying them contributes to biodiversity loss?

To help in finding concrete solutions, Belgium was be the birth place of a unique way to respond to the challenge.

For 5 nights, 30 entrepreneurs and business coaches from NESTâ€™up, the startup accelerator of Creative Wallonia, have collaborated with experts from CITES, the Convention on International Trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora; its secretariat being administered by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP).

The objective? To tackle an environmental challenge of legal, sustainable and tracable trade in
wildlife through using the techniques and methods proven to successfully develop innovative companies.

This unprecedented collaboration between entrepreneurs and CITES experts is also a concrete illustration of the Green Economy strongly advocated by UNEP. Thanks to
this joint effort, we can expect further progress in the fight against overexploitation of wild species.
